##Introduction<br>
<br>
This lab is the implementation of the specifications laid out on the [lab website](ece382.com/labs/lab5/index.html).  This implementation of the lab meets required, B, and A functionality.  In addition, it also meets the additional features requirement of the lab.<br>

Four different libraries were used in the creation of this program.  Three of the libraries are written by me.  However one of the libraries is a copy of a publicly available code for random number generation.  The following libraries are:<br>
[LCDDriver](https://github.com/KevinCooper/LCDDriver/)<br>
[clock](https://github.com/KevinCooper/clock/)<br>
[TemplateGame](https://github.com/KevinCooper/TemplateGame/)<br>
[msp430-rng](https://github.com/KevinCooper/msp430-rng/)<br>

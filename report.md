# Lab05

## Objective / Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to utilize the knowledge of timers and interrupts to create a 2D game that is controllable through user button input.  The buttons should be trigegred using interrupts.  In addition the timer is used to determine whether the player has taken to long to make a move and lose the game.
## Preliminary Design
The first part of this lab will be to implement the logic for the game.  by designing it in a way that will allow for easy implentation with my LCDDriver will allow for the two libraries to be combined in a short amount of time.  The logic for the interrupts and timer will be the last compenent to be added to the design.
